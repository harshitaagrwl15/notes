Hi Priya,
I have updated the cloudformation code to create a certificate manager. But, the cloudformation event stucks in between because "assumed role is not authorized to access the cross account DOmain to update the record". I am thinking to create an IAM Role from cloudformation code and provide cross account domain access. For now, Can I update my iam role access for the same to test out?
